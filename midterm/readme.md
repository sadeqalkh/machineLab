This project will use both the stepper and the servo motor for the RC car movements. The role of the stepper motor is to act as the force that makes the RC cars moves forward and backward. The servo motor however, will turn the front wheels right and left that is by the help of the linkages. The arduoino in this project will be positioned as a hard drive, that will save specific commands to motivate the movements of the RC car. The RC car in this project will not be controlled by a user. The main body of the RC car will be created from 3 packed cardboards, due to their weight and also, it will ease the force of the motors while it is powered.


Here are the materials that will be used for the body:
